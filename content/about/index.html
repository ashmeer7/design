<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Based out of New York and Boston, I am a 20-year-old student at Harvard University. I 
use photography, graphic design, digital illustration and video to make the beauty of the 
world tangible. Embarking on Saad Amer Design, I want to expose the elegance and 
simplicity of the forms we come across daily. 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My works have been published by Vogue Italia, Bund Magazine (China), Samsung USA, 
Star Central Magazine, Tuesday Magazine and more. In addition, I have received the 
Congressional Artist Award from the U.S. House of Representatives, won an $80,000 
First Place Prize from Samsung Solve For Tomorrow Environmental Video Contest and 
was a Finalist in the United States Environmental Protection Agency Rachel Carson 
Photography Contest. I have also worked as the Creative Director of Jalato and as the 
Image Director for TheUnsungHeroine.

Regarding Saad Amer Design, people often ask what exactly it is that I design. With an 
elated sense of what the world looks like, my work seeks to refine reality for its viewers. 
My images evaporate the nebulosity out of our immediacy, and expose a distilled sense 
of forthrightness about the world we live in. I ultimately design the space I am consumed 
in by regurgitating beauty from the stimuli it provides me with.
